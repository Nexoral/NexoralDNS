// Function to forward DNS query to Global DNS
/**
 * Forwards a DNS query to a list of global DNS servers sequentially until a response is received or all servers fail to respond.
 *
 * @param msg - The DNS query message as a Buffer.
 * @param queryName - The domain name being queried.
 * @returns A Promise that resolves with the DNS response Buffer if successful, or `null` if no server responds.
 *
 * The function attempts to send the DNS query to each server in the `GlobalDNS` array, waiting up to 2 seconds for a response from each.
 * If a server does not respond or an error occurs, it proceeds to the next server.
 * The process continues until a response is received or all servers have been tried.
